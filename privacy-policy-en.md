Last Updated: February 10, 2026

Pushup Habit ("the App") is designed with your privacy as a top priority. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App handles and how it is protected.

The App stores the following workout-related data **only on your device**:

## 4. Advertising & Tracking

The App contains **no advertising SDKs, tracking tools, or analytics tools**.

The App does not intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

## 6. Data Deletion

You can delete all stored workout data from "Settings" → "Data Management" → "Reset All Data" within the App. Uninstalling the App will also completely delete all data.
